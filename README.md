We need an application for storing **Students** and **Teachers** information like **name**, **age**, **group** and
**courses**. We have two type of courses - **Main** and **Secondary**.

- [x] which students participate in specific course
- [x] which students participate in specific group
- [x] find all teachers and students for specific group and course
